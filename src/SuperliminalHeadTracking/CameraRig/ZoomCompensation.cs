    /// FoVEnterColliderLerp widens toward 100 degrees as the player approaches its
    /// trigger, and DollyEffect and DollyObject rewrite it continuously to hold an
    /// object's on-screen size while the player walks - the dolly-zoom the game
    /// builds set pieces out of. A wide FOV shrinks everything in the frame, head
    /// tracking included: the head still turns ten degrees and the camera still
    /// turns ten degrees, and the picture simply moves less, by the ratio between
    /// the two fields of view. At 70 out to 100 that is 1.70x the other way, and a
    /// player does not read it as the room stretching - they read it as the mod's
    /// sensitivity changing under them.
    ///
    /// This is an engine-boundary conversion in the same family as the axis signs,
    /// not a sensitivity knob and not an aim-down-sights setting. It is exactly 1.0
    /// whenever the game is at its own un-zoomed FOV, so ordinary play is untouched,
    /// and nothing about it is user-configurable.
